# Pick a base image to serve as the foundation for the other build stages in
# this file.
#
# For illustrative purposes, the following FROM command
# is using the alpine image (see https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).
# By specifying the "latest" tag, it will also use whatever happens to be the
# most recent version of that image when you build your Dockerfile.
# If reproducability is important, consider using a versioned tag
# (e.g., alpine:3.17.2) or SHA (e.g., alpine@sha256:c41ab5c992deb4fe7e5da09f67a8804a46bd0592bfdf0b1847dde0e0889d2bff).

# Create a stage for building/compiling the application.
#
# The following commands will leverage the "base" stage above to generate
# a "hello world" script and make it executable, but for a real application, you
# would issue a RUN command for your application's build process to generate the
# executable. For language-specific examples, take a look at the Dockerfiles in
# the Awesome Compose repository: https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
FROM base as build
RUN echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n\
echo Hello world from $(whoami)! In order to get your application running in a container, take a look at the comments in the Dockerfile to get started.'\
> /bin/hello.sh
RUN chmod +x /bin/hello.sh

################################################################################
# Create a final stage for running your application.
#
# The following commands copy the output from the "build" stage above and tell
# the container runtime to execute it when the image is run. Ideally this stage
# contains the minimal runtime dependencies for the application as to produce
# the smallest image possible. This often means using a different and smaller
# image than the one used for building the application, but for illustrative
# purposes the "base" image is used here.
